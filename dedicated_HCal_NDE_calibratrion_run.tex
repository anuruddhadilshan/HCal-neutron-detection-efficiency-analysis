\section{Dedicated run for HCal NDE calibration during GEn-RP experiment}

It has been suggested to take a dedicated set of data for the HCal NDE calibration via the end-point technique during the upcoming GEn-RP experiment run period under the following run conditions.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item BigBite magnet polarity reversed (positive) 
    \item Copper radiator in front of the LH2 target
    \item The steel analyzer of the GEn-RP inline stack removed.
\end{enumerate}


The following points were discussed during the 12/15/2023 GMn analysis meeting about preparation/requirements for this run:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Single pi+ photo-production event rate estimations with the simulations - rate must be good with the copper radiator on.
    \item Overall run time should be a few hours to a shift at max? - will have to talk with GEn-RP spokespeople.
    \item Make sure the momentum difference between the single pion and multi pion BB tracks are larger than 1.5\% (BB mom resolution) + safety margin, for the proposed GEn-RP kinematic. See Table: \ref{Table: Threshold calculation results for the actual GMn kinematics} last row, SBS-12. If the GEn-RP kinematics stays the same, then this should not be a problem as the difference is at comparable levels with SBS-9 which is currently being analyzed.
\end{itemize}
